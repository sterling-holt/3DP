# This file contains common pin mappings for the BIGTREETECH SKR mini
# E3 v3.0. To use this config, the firmware should be compiled for the
# STM32G0B1 with a "8KiB bootloader" and USB communication/USART.

# The "make flash" command does not work on the SKR mini E3. Instead,
# after running "make", copy the generated "out/klipper.bin" file to a
# file named "firmware.bin" on an SD card and then restart the SKR
# mini E3 with that SD card.

# See docs/Config_Reference.md for a description of parameters.
